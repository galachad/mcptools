\title{R as a server: Configure R-based tools with LLM-enabled apps}
\usage{
mcp_server(tools = NULL, ..., session_tools = TRUE)

mcp_session()
}
\arguments{
\item{tools}{Optional collection of tools to expose. Supply either a list
of objects created by \code{\link[ellmer:tool]{ellmer::tool()}} or a path to an \code{.R} file that,
when sourced, yields such a list. Defaults to \code{NULL}, which serves only
the built-in session tools when \code{session_tools} is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{...}{Reserved for future use; currently ignored.}

\item{session_tools}{Logical value whether to include the built-in session
tools (\code{list_r_sessions}, \code{select_r_session}) that work with
\code{mcp_session()}. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
\code{mcp_server()} and \code{mcp_session()} are both called primarily for their
side-effects.
\itemize{
\item \code{mcp_server()} blocks the R process it's called in indefinitely and isn't
intended for interactive use.
\item \code{mcp_session()} makes the interactive R session it's called in available to
MCP servers. It returns the \pkg{nanonext} socket used for communicating
with the server. Call \code{\link[=close]{close()}} on the socket to stop the session.
}
}
\description{
\code{mcp_server()} implements a model context protocol server with arbitrary
R functions as its tools. Optionally, calling \code{mcp_session()} in an
interactive R session allows those tools to execute inside of that session.
}
\section{Configuration}{


\code{\link[=mcp_server]{mcp_server()}} should be configured with the MCP clients via the \code{Rscript}
command. For example, to use with Claude Desktop, paste the following in your
Claude Desktop configuration (on macOS, at
\code{file.edit("~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json")}):

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode json">}}\preformatted{\{
  "mcpServers": \{
    "r-mcptools": \{
      "command": "Rscript",
      "args": ["-e", "mcptools::mcp_server()"]
    \}
  \}
\}
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

Or, to use with Claude Code, you might type in a terminal:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode bash">}}\preformatted{claude mcp add -s "user" r-mcptools Rscript -e "mcptools::mcp_server()"
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

\strong{mcp_server() is not intended for interactive use.}

The server interfaces with the MCP client. If you'd like tools to have access
to variables inside of an interactive R session, call
\code{mcp_session()} to make your R session available to the server.
Place a call to \code{mcptools::mcp_session()} in your \code{.Rprofile}, perhaps with
\code{usethis::edit_r_profile()}, to make every interactive R session you start
available to the server.

On Windows, you may need to configure the full path to the Rscript executable.
Examples for Claude Code on WSL and Claude Desktop on Windows are shown
at \url{https://github.com/posit-dev/mcptools/issues/41#issuecomment-3036617046}.
