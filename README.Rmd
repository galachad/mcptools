The goal of rmcp is to enable LLM-enabled tools like Claude Code to learn about the R packages you have installed using the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP). Tools configured with rmcp can peruse package documentation and learn to use R packages even if they weren't included in their training data.

rmcp is written primarily in TypeScript but is distributed as an R package for ease of distribution/install for R users. Installing the package ensures you have the needed dependencies and provides a shortcut, `mcp_config()`, to help you configure the tool with other applications.

> IMPORTANT:
> This is an early proof of concept. Use at your own risk!

## Installation

You can install the development version of rmcp like so:

```r
pak::pak("simonpcouch/rmcp")
```

rmcp can be hooked up to any application that supports MCP. Use `mcp_config()` to generate the config for your machine for common applications. For example, **Claude Code**:

```{r}
library(rmcp)

mcp_config("Claude Code")
```

Or, **Claude Desktop**:

```{r}
mcp_config("Claude Desktop")
```

## Example

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-alt: "A screencast of a chat with Claude. I ask 'Using the R packages I have installed, write code to download data on flights in/out of Chicago airports in 2024.' and, after searching through the documentation of my currently installed R packages, Claude writes R code to do so."
