**Comments for CRAN team**:

There's 1 NOTE as this is an initial release.

There are not references describing the methods in this package to cite in the Description field.

This is a **resubmission**; the first submission of the package was rejected due to the name of the protocol being single-quoted in the Description field an example's execution being wrapped in `if (FALSE)`. Thank you for the feedback—both of these issues have been addressed.
